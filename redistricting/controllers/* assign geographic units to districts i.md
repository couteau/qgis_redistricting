* assign geographic units to districts in a redistricting plan
* specify redistricting plan parameters used to assign geographic units to districts and validate acceptability of redistricting plans
  - number of districts
  - number of members in districted unit of government
  - acceptable population deviation
  - 1 geography to be districted, in base geographic units (vector layer, possibly filtered to smaller governmental unit)
    . base geographic units are the smallest units of geography from which districts will be built
    . base geographic units must cover entire geography to be districted
  - 0 or more additional geographic units used for districting (made up of whole base geographic units)
  - 1 source of population data for geographic units (vector layer) 
  - 1 primary population field used for assessing population equality/deviation of districts
  - 0 or more additional population fields for relevant measures of population in districts
  - 0 or mor demographic subpopulation fields
* calculate demographic data for districts
* calculate geographic metrics for districts
* calculate split geographies within redistricting plans
