Data Table Window
=================

The data table window provides demographics and metrics for each district in
your plan. It shows the total population for each district, the totals for
each additional population total in your plan and the the totals for each of
the demographic date fields you've added. In addition, it shows the population
deviation as an absolute and as a percentage of the total population. If the
district falls without the allowed deviation, the deviation figures are
displayed on a green background. The data table also shows select compactness
scores for each district.
